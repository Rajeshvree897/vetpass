Where this is the case, the Data Subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a Data Subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c) Right to rectification</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the Controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate Personal Data concerning him or her. Considering the purposes of the processing, the Data Subject shall have the right to have incomplete Personal Data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a Data Subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the Controller the erasure of Personal Data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the Controller shall have the obligation to erase Personal Data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies if the processing is not necessary:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Data Subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Data Subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the Data Subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Personal Data has been unlawfully processed.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Personal Data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in European Union or Member State law to which the Controller is subject.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Personal Data has been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If one of the reasons applies, and a Data Subject wishes to request the erasure of Personal Data stored by VETPASS he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer who shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the Controller has made Personal Data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the Personal Data, the Controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other Controllers processing the Personal Data that the Data Subject has requested the erasure by such Controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those Personal Data, as far as processing is not required. Our Data Protection Officer will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>e) Right of restriction of processing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the Controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The accuracy of the Personal Data is contested by the Data Subject, for a period enabling the Controller to verify the accuracy of the Personal Data.</li>\r\n\t<li>The processing is unlawful, and the Data Subject opposes the erasure of the Personal Data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Controller no longer needs the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the Data Subject for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Data Subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification of whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the Data Subject.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If one of the conditions is met, and a Data Subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of Personal Data stored by VETPASS he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer who will arrange the restriction of the processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>f) Right to data portability</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the Personal Data concerning him or her, which was provided to a Controller, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another Controller without hindrance from the Controller to which the Personal Data has been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Controller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the Data Subject shall have the right to have Personal Data transmitted directly from one Controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To assert the right to data portability, the Data Subject may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>g) Right to object</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her situation, at any time, to processing of Personal Data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VETPASS shall no longer process the Personal Data in the event of the objection unless We can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the Data Subject, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If VETPASS processes Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, the Data Subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of Personal Data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the Data Subject objects to VETPASS to the processing for direct marketing purposes, VETPASS will no longer process the Personal Data for these purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Data Subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her situation, to object to the processing of Personal Data concerning him or her by VETPASS for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To exercise the right to object, the Data Subject may directly contact the VETPASS Data Protection Officer. In addition, the Data Subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the Data Subject and a data Controller, or (2) is not authorized by European Union or Member State law to which the Controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the Data Subject&#39;s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the Data Subject&#39;s explicit consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering, or the performance of, a contract between the Data Subject and a Data Controller, or (2) it is based on the Data Subject&#39;s explicit consent, VETPASS shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the Data Subject&#39;s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the Controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Data Subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may at any time directly contact the VETPASS Data Protection Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to the processing of his or her Personal Data at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Data Subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may at any time directly contact the VETPASS Data Protection Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Legal basis for the processing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which We obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the processing of Personal Data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If&nbsp;our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of Personal Data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In rare cases, the processing of Personal Data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his or her name, age, health insurance data, or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital, or another third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations that are not covered by any of the above mentioned legal grounds, if the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject which require protection of Personal Data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the Data Subject is a client of the Controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. The legitimate interests pursued by the Controller or by a third party</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the processing of Personal Data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders and their heirs and assignees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Period for which the Personal Data will be stored</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of Personal Data is the respective statutory retention period. After the expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, if it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter a contract; Obligation of the Data Subject to provide the Personal Data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We clarify that the provision of Personal Data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g., information on the contractual partner).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the Data Subject provides Us with Personal Data, which must subsequently be processed by Us. The Data Subject is, for example, obliged to provide Us with Personal Data when VETPASS signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the Personal Data would have the consequence that the contract with the Data Subject could not be concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Personal Data is provided by the Data Subject, the Data Subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the Data Subject whether the provision of the Personal Data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the Personal Data and the consequences of non-provision of the Personal Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Existence of automated decision-making</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a responsible company, We do not use automatic decision-making or profiling (see section e above for definition).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Payments and GDPR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We collect and store your service usage and transactional information to enable you to view certain details of all your transactions that have been made using our services, to provide you uninterrupted and satisfactory services, to administer our relationship with you, to comply with any statutory or regulatory requirement, to monitor your use of our services for the purposes of ensuring compliance with our user rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combinations of the information collected as mentioned in this Privacy Policy such as name, email address, telephone and company name when coupled with information which is not Personal Information such as speed of typing, the maximum screen area usage, other patterns, and data help Us detect and protect Users and ourselves against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11.

Our Data Protection Officer will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>e) Right of restriction of processing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the Controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The accuracy of the Personal Data is contested by the Data Subject, for a period enabling the Controller to verify the accuracy of the Personal Data.</li>\r\n\t<li>The processing is unlawful, and the Data Subject opposes the erasure of the Personal Data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Controller no longer needs the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the Data Subject for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Data Subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification of whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the Data Subject.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If one of the conditions is met, and a Data Subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of Personal Data stored by VETPASS he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer who will arrange the restriction of the processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>f) Right to data portability</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the Personal Data concerning him or her, which was provided to a Controller, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another Controller without hindrance from the Controller to which the Personal Data has been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Controller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the Data Subject shall have the right to have Personal Data transmitted directly from one Controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To assert the right to data portability, the Data Subject may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>g) Right to object</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her situation, at any time, to processing of Personal Data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VETPASS shall no longer process the Personal Data in the event of the objection unless We can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the Data Subject, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If VETPASS processes Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, the Data Subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of Personal Data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the Data Subject objects to VETPASS to the processing for direct marketing purposes, VETPASS will no longer process the Personal Data for these purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Data Subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her situation, to object to the processing of Personal Data concerning him or her by VETPASS for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To exercise the right to object, the Data Subject may directly contact the VETPASS Data Protection Officer. In addition, the Data Subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the Data Subject and a data Controller, or (2) is not authorized by European Union or Member State law to which the Controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the Data Subject&#39;s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the Data Subject&#39;s explicit consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering, or the performance of, a contract between the Data Subject and a Data Controller, or (2) it is based on the Data Subject&#39;s explicit consent, VETPASS shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the Data Subject&#39;s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the Controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Data Subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may at any time directly contact the VETPASS Data Protection Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Data Subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her Personal Data at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Data Subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may at any time directly contact the VETPASS Data Protection Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Legal basis for the processing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which We obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of Personal Data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of Personal Data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of Personal Data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his or her name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the above mentioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject which require protection of Personal Data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the Data Subject is a client of the Controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. The legitimate interests pursued by the Controller or by a third party</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the processing of Personal Data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Period for which the Personal Data will be stored</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of Personal Data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, if it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Provision of Personal Data as a statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter a contract; Obligation of the Data Subject to provide the Personal Data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We clarify that the provision of Personal Data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g., information on the contractual partner).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the Data Subject provides Us with Personal Data, which must subsequently be processed by Us. The Data Subject is, for example, obliged to provide Us with Personal Data when VETPASS signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the Personal Data would have the consequence that the contract with the Data Subject could not be concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Personal Data is provided by the Data Subject, the Data Subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the Data Subject whether the provision of the Personal Data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the Personal Data and the consequences of non-provision of the Personal Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Existence of automated decision-making</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a responsible company, We do not use automatic decision-making or profiling (see section e above for definition).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.

Cookies also help Us keep Your account safe. By continuing to visit or use Our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes We describe in this policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT IS A COOKIE?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cookie is a small file placed onto Your device that enables VETPASS features and functionality. For example, cookies enable Us to identify Your device, secure Your access to VETPASS and Our Websites and Applications generally, and even help Us know if someone attempts to access Your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on VETPASS and help Us serve relevant ads to Your animal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHEN DOES VETPASS PLACE COOKIES?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use cookies on Our Apps and Web Websites and Applications (such as www.vetpass.com) and mobile applications. Any browser visiting these Websites and Applications will receive cookies from Us. We also place cookies in Your browser when you visit non-VETPASS Websites and Applications that host Our plugins or tags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DOES VETPASS USE?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps Us recognize you as an existing user, so it is easier to return to VETPASS or interact with Our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in Your browser and will be read by VETPASS when you return to Our Websites and Applications. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Our Websites and Applications remember Your preferences and give you a personalized experience that is in line with Your settings. Cookies also make Your interactions with VETPASS faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow Us to bring you advertising and bring customized features through VETPASS plugins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CATEGORIES OF COOKIE AND DESCRIPTION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authentication: If you are signed in to VETPASS, cookies help Us show you the right information and personalize Your experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Security:&nbsp; We use cookies to enable and support Our security features, and to help Us detect malicious activity and any breaches of Our Terms and Conditions (which incorporates Our End User License Agreement and Our Privacy Policy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Features and services:&nbsp; Cookies can tell Us which language you prefer and what Your communications preferences are. They can help you fill out forms on VETPASS more easily. They also provide you with features, insights, and customized content in conjunction with Our plugins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertising:&nbsp; We may use cookies to show you relevant advertising both on and off the VETPASS site. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action e.g., made a purchase. Similarly, Our partners may use a cookie to determine whether We have shown an ad and how it performed or provide Us with information about how you interact with ads. We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off VETPASS, such as after you have visited a partner&rsquo;s site or application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performance, Analytics, and Research: Cookies help Us learn how well Our site and plugins perform in different locations. We also use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access VETPASS from other Websites and Applications, applications, or devices such as Your work computer or Your mobile device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT IS DO NOT TRACK (DNT)?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across Websites and Applications by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, VETPASS does not generally respond to &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT THIRD-PARTY COOKIES DOES VETPASS USE?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our cookie table lists some of the third-party cookies on Our Websites and Applications. Please note that the names of cookies, pixels, and other technologies may change over time. Please also note that companies and other organizations that sponsor pages on VETPASS may use cookies, pixels, or other technologies on their VETPASS pages to learn about Your interest in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CONTROLLING COOKIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of Websites and Applications to set cookies, you may worsen Your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to Your animal. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT TO DO IF YOU DO NOT WANT COOKIES TO BE SET OR WANT THEM TO BE REMOVED?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a visitor, you can opt out of Our advertising cookies here.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive cookies, you can also change Your browser settings on Your computer or another device you are using to access Our Services. If you use VETPASS without changing Your browser settings, We will assume that Your animal you are happy to receive all cookies on the VETPASS website. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies, including VETPASS cookies.
